Massachusetts General Hospital Executive KPI Dashboard
🥅Project Goal
Analyze and build reports around patient, encounter, and procedure data to provide KPI and operational performance reports, and to uncover deeper insights from the dataset.

🔑Key Steps
1️⃣ Data Exploration

Goals achieved in this step:

Broke down the analysis into non-admission encounters, Admission and Readmission encounters, and Procedures.
Identified key metrics and attributes for each analysis section:
Attributes from patient information, including key demographics such as Gender, Age, Age Group, Race, and Marital Status.
Attributes from encounters and procedures, including encounter class, encounter description, procedure description, and procedure reasons.
General metrics for encounters and procedures, including counts, costs, rates, Length of Stay (LOS), and averages.
Special metrics for analyzing readmissions and mortalities, including the admission range, dates between the current visit and previous discharge, and dates between death and each admission.
2️⃣ Data Preparation

Goal: Prepare the data for an effective data model for analysis.

Key steps taken:

🔯In Power Query:
Built dimension tables, including encounter class, age, age group, and date.
Merged encounter and patient tables to get the age at encounter and the date differences between death and each encounter.
Extracted the hour of each encounter visit.
🔯In Power BI Desktop:
Built a calculated table from the encounters table for admissions and readmissions, obtaining the previous discharge date for each admission record using the Offset function in DAX.
Calculated LOS by minutes for non-admission encounters, and by days for admission encounters. Then built LOS bins for different minute ranges.
Built an admission type calculated column to identify initial admissions and readmissions.
Built a mortality indicator calculated column for mortality rate calculation.

3️⃣ Data Model
With the earlier steps completed, the data model is now ready for dashboard development.

Special attention was given to the Procedures table. 
While it has potential links to other dimension tables, only one relationship has been established — with the Encounters table. 
This ensures a correct and consistent mapping between each procedure and its associated encounter.
